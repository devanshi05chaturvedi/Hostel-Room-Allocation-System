# Hostel-Room-Allocation-System
This is an in house project for hostel room allocation system
This website will be designed to manage information on the hostel students’ room status. The admin will allocate the hostel based on the capacity of the hostels and the
strength of the class. The student will sign up/login. It will take the class of the student and accordingly display their respective hostel’s room vacancy information.
The students will reserve their desired room and they can also request to swap/change rooms. The warden manages the requests. The main purpose is to provide an efficient
and quick way to deal with the hostel room allocation process.
